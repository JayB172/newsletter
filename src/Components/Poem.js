               <p className='poem-line'>Most playful love, cherished rival thee, who first didst win my heart.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Your triumph’s prize, sweet victory, on Nintendo Mario Cart.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Worthy foe, noble gamer, most beloved enemy,</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>We duelled at Half-Life, Counter Strike, At Halo and Doom Three.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Such sweet defeat I tasted, my craving joy to feed,</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>As my dust I ate at Grand Turismo, Dirt and Need for Speed.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Of all platforms you were Mistress: X-box, PlayStation or Wii game-cube, dream cast, mega drive or Alien ware PC.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Until Alas! Oh wretched day, detached from the affection.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>To BT didst I wail in woe until I fear I’d cry,</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>As I met with the indifference of a bored man in Mumbai.</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>‘No Man is an Island’, yes I said that but before</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Being stuck in single player on Grand Theft Auto Four,</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>Mere memories now I have thee who forced me to my breath catch,</p>
               <p className='poem-line'>When first you fragged my lamer ass, in Quake Two Online death match.</p>
